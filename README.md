# Pre course survey summary

To better understand the level of R skills and if they have their own dataset for coursework, students were asked to fill in a short online questionnaire before the course start.

Students were asked for answers to these questions:

- How big is your previous R experience?

- What operating system and version your computer is running?

- Did you have running installation of the following software on your computer?

- Do you have GitHub account?

- Do you have your own dataset (at least in mind) that you would like to use for individual project?

- If you answered 'Yes' to previous question, please describe your dataset (name, how many rows/columns/number of variables, are your values categorical or continuous, csv, json, xls, html, etc.)

To find out what were the answers to these questions please have a look at the [index.md](https://github.com/rstats-tln/questionnaire/blob/master/index.md) file on GitHub.
